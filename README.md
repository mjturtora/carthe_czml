#carthe_czml

`carthe_czml` is a python program to produce czml files from CARTHE GLAD drifter data 
using the [czml.py](https://github.com/cleder/czml) package.

If the server is running, you can view a [result here](http://comt.sura.org/proxy_3001#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjturtora/carthe_czml/master/TerriaJS%20Files/CARTHE_JSON.json)
 that loads the output into a [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) instance. TerriaJS was build on top of [CesiumJS](https://cesiumjs.org/) by the [aussies](http://www.nicta.com.au/) for their [National map](http://nationalmap.gov.au/) project.
 
 The data for the demo was from the [CARTHE Grand LAgrangian Deployment (GLAD)](http://carthe.org/glad/) experiment and can be [found here](https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/data/R1.x134.073:0004/).
